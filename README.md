# Data Structure Challenges (Part1)

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains eight projects developed as part of an online course to enhance knowledge in Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and clean code practices. Each project focuses on building and implementing various data structures and related operations in C++. The projects cover Doubly Linked List, Queue, Stack, Dynamic Array, and classes simulating undo/redo actions and a queue management system.

## Projects
### Project 1: Doubly Linked List
Implemented a Doubly Linked List class from scratch.
Includes operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
### Project 2: Queue based on Doubly Linked List
Created a Queue class utilizing the composition concept in OOP.
Built on the Doubly Linked List class to implement queue-specific functionalities.
### Project 3: Stack based on Queue
Developed a Stack class using inheritance from the Queue class.
Utilized OOP principles to extend functionality and implement stack-specific operations.
### Project 4: Dynamic Array
Implemented a Dynamic Array class with dynamic memory allocation.
Includes operations like insertion, deletion, and resizing.
### Project 5: Queue based on Dynamic Array
Created a Queue class using the Dynamic Array class through composition.
Demonstrated the versatility of the Dynamic Array class in different data structures.
### Project 6: Stack based on Dynamic Array
Extended the Queue class to create a Stack class using inheritance.
Leveraged the Dynamic Array class to implement stack-specific features.
### Project 7: Undo/Redo Simulation
Implemented a class to simulate undo and redo actions using the Stack data structure.
Enhanced understanding of stack-related functionalities.
### Project 8: Queue Management System
Developed a class for a queue management system using the Queue data structure.
Gained familiarity with queue-specific operations and applications.

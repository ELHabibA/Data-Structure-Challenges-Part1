# Data Structure Challenges (Part1)

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains eight projects (Classes) developed as part of an online course to enhance knowledge in Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and clean code practices. Each project focuses on building and implementing various data structures and related operations in C++. The projects cover Doubly Linked List, Queue, Stack, Dynamic Array, and classes simulating undo/redo actions and a queue management system.

## Projects
### Project 1: Doubly Linked List
Implemented a Doubly Linked List class from scratch and Included operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Project 2: Queue based on Doubly Linked List
Created a Queue class utilizing the composition concept in OOP. The queue class was built on the Doubly Linked List class to implement queue-specific functionalities.

### Project 3: Stack based on Queue
Developed a Stack class using inheritance from the Queue class and utilized OOP principles to extend functionality and implement stack-specific operations.

### Project 4: Dynamic Array
Implemented a Dynamic Array class with dynamic memory allocation and included operations like insertion, deletion, and resizing.

### Project 5: Queue based on Dynamic Array
Created a Queue class using the Dynamic Array class through composition.

### Project 6: Stack based on Dynamic Array
Extended the Queue class to create a Stack class using inheritance.

### Project 7: Undo/Redo Simulation
Implemented a class to simulate undo and redo actions using the Stack data structure, To Enhance understanding of stack-related functionalities.

### Project 8: Queue Management System
Developed a class for a Line management system using the Queue data structure. Gained familiarity with queue-specific operations and applications.
